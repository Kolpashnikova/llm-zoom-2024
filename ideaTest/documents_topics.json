I am also familiar with the application procedures for CIHR and NIH because I have been preparing my own grant application for the CIHR Project Grant this year, and it has been a dream of mine to get an NIH R01 for a long time. With that in mind, I have been creating a collection of successful NIH R01 examples for my own use for quite a while."

        "text": "I like implementing innovative teaching methods and techniques, particularly in the instruction of quantitative and computational methods. In 2015, I co-designed a teaching experiment on the effective instruction of quantitative methods to undergraduate arts students. The teaching experiment used a flipped classroom technique, where lecture materials were delivered in video tutorials while the classroom time was devoted to hands-on labs and exercises. This experiment (Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 2019) shows that although knowledge acquisition increases with innovative teaching techniques, student attitudes are much slower to change. I contend that the slow nature of changing attitudes suggests the attitudes toward methods classes needs to be addressed at the curriculum level. The project was recognised by the Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund at UBC and the Carla B Howery Teaching Enhancement Fund of the American Sociological Association (PI: Silvia Bartolic, UBC). I credit my overall professional progress to strong mentorship and recognise teaching as a critical factor for transforming students into strong academics and professionals. "

I worked with nationally representative cross-sectional and panel data such as the Canadian General Social Survey (Time Use), the American Time Use Survey, the International Social Survey Programme, and English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, among many others. For analyses, I work with Stata, R, Python, and Julia. I also program in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL for research communication initiatives (e.g., https://data-science-for-social-scientists.github.io/). I have developed a number of data visualization packages in R, combining R and JavaScript. Although I prefer using more researcher-oriented tools for data visualizations like R and Python, I am familiar with Tableau, too. "

I am proficient in overseeing project progress, setting and reporting milestones and deliverables, as well as in developing and implementing projects from start to finish. During my PhD and postdoctoral years, I acquired a wealth of knowledge and experience in applying for grants and fellowships, overseeing the process, and submitting reports for the related projects. This has made me familiar with various granting organizations and their processes, both in Canada and internationally. For example, my research has been recognized by grants and fellowships such as the ERC’s 2020-2022 Marie Curie Fellowship (£220,000), Taiwan Fellowship (2018), VISTA Fellowship (2022~), Mitacs Accelerate Fund (2014), and Oxford’s John Fell Fund (£6,750) in 2019-2021."

I supervised two MSc students, interested in the gendered division of labour at the OECD Academy and Oxford. I credit my overall professional progress to strong mentorship and thus recognise teaching as a critical factor for transforming students into strong academics and professionals. "
