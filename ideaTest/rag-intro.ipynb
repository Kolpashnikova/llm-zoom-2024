This interest is evidenced by my research and analysis of data sources from across North America, Europe, Central Asia and East Asia. Over the years, I have acquired a unique proficiency working with national and multinational datasets from these regions. This has not only reinforced my adaptability and versatility while working with diverse cultures but also familiarized me with the methodological nuances of dealing with multiple data sources. In addition, my broad-based research on gender inequality and unpaid work across different socio-cultural contexts has been published in leading journals, a further testament of my versatility and comfort in diverse settings. My experiences ensure that I am well equipped to work and live in varying cultural contexts which in turn fosters my commitment towards enriching the roles I undertake.'"

My proficiency in both quantitative and qualitative research was honed from my tenure at Oxford where I used state-of-the-art quantitative methodologies including sequence analysis and multi-level mixed-effect models to analyze and investigate the variations in time-use among women caregivers and older adults. My expertise extends to a diverse range of research interests, machine learning included, which I plan to utilize to its full extent for further growth and development of this project, especially given the large complex legacy data. Recently, I led workshops on sequence analysis at Oxford, teaching early career researchers, showcasing my ability to impart knowledge as well as learn from it. I also have a robust training in statistics and am able to use a variety of programming languages and analysis tools, which I have employed in my research and communication initiatives. I am confident that these skills will be highly beneficial in teaching and engaging in meaningful communication.'"
